#Project Documentation
AI Chatbots and Recommendation Systems Semester Project 


## Final Release
For the final release of this project, we attempted to follow the general file structure as outlined in this repo provided by the professor https://github.com/miguelgfierro/project_template/releases/tag/0.1.0

We will break down the documentation based on each subdirectory:

## .github/workflows
This is where our workflows file goes. Here, we have automated a GitHub workflow to automatically execute a PR gate and then run all the pytests.

## examples/models
This is the subdirectory where our core models go. We attempted the project with two different models - SAR and KNN. In the end, we chose the SAR model as we were able to resolve the hot start problem with that but did not have the time to properly solve the cold start problem in the KNN model (more on this in the elaboration on the model itself).
